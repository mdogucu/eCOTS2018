## Abstract

While working on statistics projects, students often lean on the internet as 
the source of data. They locate a data table online and try to copy and paste 
it into Excel. Hand scraping data from the web can lead to oddly-formatted Excel 
files full of hyperlinks and empty cells, which often requires further manual 
cleaning of the data in a non-reproducible way in order to get it into a tidy 
data frame to base a statistical analysis on. Web-scraping can help prevent 
foreseeable errors, automates the repetitive task of copying and pasting across 
multiple webpages, and enables access to larger amount of data in a short span 
of time. We will share our experiences and examples of web scraping activities 
from our classrooms and how we link this relatively modern technique with 
traditional statistics topics such as multiple regression.
